            <p>When I moved to Cardiff a year ago, I did not expect to spend the latter half indoors while a pandemic raged through the world outdoors. The small window in my room looked out at the City Centre, which was usually bustling with people, but was suddenly quiet and empty because of lockdown. The shops were all closed, no lights or activity behind the glass windows; barring the Sainsbury’s and the Tesco, of course.</p>
            <p>However, local businesses I regularly frequented with my friends – The Little Man Café for coffee and assignments, Breatos at the Students’ Union for burritos, and Sobey’s, just to look at slightly-overpriced refurbished clothing – no longer had an income.</p>
            <p>That is what inspired the idea for this dissertation. I wanted to gauge the impact the pandemic was having on businesses; backed up by data from the Office for National Statistics, and through the eyes of business-owners who had never faced something like this before.</p>
            <p>While there is massive scope for coverage under this subject, it was evident from the data that the arts and the hospitality sectors were most impacted.</p>
            <p>The first story talks about pubs in Wales – and how the pandemic was another addition to a myriad of problems they were already facing. The second brings us some cause for optimism, as data showed that new businesses continued to crop up despite the economic downturn. Lastly, we hear from the arts centres, who have been unable to put on a play since March, and still do not see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
            <p>Each story is told through the lens of the trends seen within data, but also reminds the reader that there are real people behind the numbers.</p>
