              <h1>Arts Centres Brace for Reduced Support in Their Unending Quarantine</h1>
              <h2>Businesses in the arts, entertainment, and the recreation industries have had fewer people carry on working than any other sector. According to the latest <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/bulletins/coronavirusandtheeconomicimpactsontheuk/22october2020">data</a> from the Office for National Statistics, 28% of their workforce continues to remain on full or partial furlough - highest across all industries. With no indication of when they might be able to reopen and reduced support from Chancellor Rishi Sunak's new Job Support Scheme, things are looking grim.</h2>

              <p>When Louise Miles-Payne took up her job as the director of the arts agency Creu Cymru earlier this year, she had not anticipated that the nature of her work would drastically change.</p>
              <p>A developmental agency for theatres and arts centres in Wales, Creu Cymru ran training programs, facilitated networking between venues, and provided 'Go & See' schemes to events like the Edinburgh Fringe Festival among other things. But like everyone else, they've had to quickly adapt to the challenges brought by the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
              <p>"As lockdown began, I saw all the theatres close and everything that I had planned to do with this job has been put on hold," says Louise. "It's just been about Covid support and fighting to get all the resources we need. It's the most advocacy this organisation has ever done."</p>
              <p>Theatres and arts venues in Wales have been closed since the UK first went into lockdown in March this year. While art galleries and cafes (that are a part of venues) were allowed to open as restrictions eased in late July, theatres still haven't been able to put on performances.</p>
              <p>"Each of them are unique and are going through different things, but everyone has the same issue - they can't open, they've got no income coming in," says Louise.</p>
              <p>"There are some that have got cinemas and gallery spaces - so they're open slightly. But because they can't put performances on, they can't generate the largest proportion of their income."</p>
              <p>According to HMRC data, over 20,000 businesses in the Arts, Entertainment and Recreation sector in the UK had put over 200,000 of their employees on furlough as of 31st of August, 2020. That has reduced by half from the peak of 443,000 employees furloughed back in June.</p>

              <p>Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff has been a hub for artists in the city over the past forty years. The venue, which has a theatre, an art gallery, a café bar, and a cinema, has been closed for nearly seven months.</p>
              <p>"We as an arts organisation earn 80% of our own money through ticket sales, our café bar, and classes among other things," says Andy Eagle, Director at Chapter Arts.</p>
              <p>"The pandemic put a brake on that overnight."</p>
              <p>Most of their staff was put on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where the government bore 80% of an employee's wage costs. Nine core members of the team stayed behind with a primary goal of raising funds.</p>
              <p>"We were very lucky with a generous donation from a Cardiff-based trust that gave us emergency money to keep us ticking over. We had very, very generous donations from our audiences and customers, which now equal close to £50,000, which in the short term was essential."</p>
              <p>They also received help from Arts Council of Wales' emergency funds and a government-backed loan from Barclays to assist with their cash flows.</p>
              <p>"Somehow we've stabilized the company and we're looking forward to reopening now," says Andy.</p>
              <p>But as the UK Government phases out the more generous Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in favour of the Job Support Scheme from the 1st of November, redundancies are on the cards for the sector.</p>
              <p>The new Job Support Scheme requires an employee to work for a minimum of 20% of their total hours to be eligible for government support. The employer would have to pay 5%, while the government would fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked, up to £1,541 per month.</p>
              <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4136574"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
              <p>"The main issue is that we still don't have permission to open our theatres," says Louise Miles-Payne of Creu Cymru.</p>
              <p>Andy Eagle of Chapter also believes that the scheme did not address some of the subtleties of the arts sector.</p>
              <p>"I think the frustration is that the creative industries are such a success story in the UK. They could have been a little more understanding of the sector's specific needs."</p>
              <p>Eagle says they are in the process of making a few people redundant despite the scheme.</p>
              <p>"It's a pretty small number, but nevertheless we need to do it," he says. "It's mainly because our way of doing things is going to be different. We're not going to have programs as big as we did before for a while."</p>
              <p>Jon Morgan, Director of Theatres Trust, a UK-wide industry body called for more sector-specific support.</p>
              <p>"It remains the case that most theatres in all areas are unable to reopen viably under social distancing," he said in a <a href = "http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/latest/news/1354-chancellor-increases-financial-support">press release</a>.</p>
              <p>"We therefore urge the Chancellor to implement a sector specific support scheme for theatres and other events spaces which cannot reopen and are rapidly running out of money. This is vital to prevent further job losses on top of the 7,500 plus the industry has already suffered."</p>
              <p>Louise of Creu Cymru warns that this will also create a ripple effect on industries that depend on the arts. Venues work in tandem with other businesses in the area for catering, local hotels for performers and audiences, technical workers to do lighting and rigs, among other things.</p>
              <p>"By not putting on a show, these elements are affected as well and so is the staff that may have lost jobs during this time," says Louise. "The impact of that is being felt but is hard to quantify."</p>
              <p>But apart from the business cost, there is also a mental health cost attached.</p>
              <p>"One of my venues said to me it was like watching your first child die.", she says, "The senior managers of these spaces don't want to make these decisions. They don't want to make people redundant - especially over Zoom. Nobody wants to do that."</p>
              <p>"You can see it in people's faces, the toll it's taking. It's tricky."</p>
