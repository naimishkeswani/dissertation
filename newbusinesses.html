              <h1>New Business Numbers Buck UK Lockdown Trends</h1>
              <h2>The first three months of the pandemic saw only a very small drop in the number of new UK businesses, compared to the same period the year before. Almost 90,000 new businesses were registered, down from 101,990, as entrepreneurs exploited extra time at home, unemployment or voluntary redundancy to strike out by themselves.</h2>

              <p>A few weeks into the lockdown, Caroline and her partner Jai found themselves missing their date nights. Being cooped up in their London apartment with plenty of free time and nowhere to go, they quickly ran out of activities to do together.</p>

              <p>“We couldn’t find any great alternatives other than the classic suggestions to ‘cook together’ or ‘work out together’ — neither of which felt romantic!” says Caroline.</p>

              <p>That is what sparked the idea for their venture <a href = "https://www.thebox42.co.uk/">Box42</a>, a date night subscription service. Each box is based on a theme and comes with planned activities, a dinner menu, accessories, and some snacks among other things. To capitalise on the gap they saw in the market, the couple quickly got to work and launched their service in July. By August, they had sold dozens of units.</p>

              <p>While the pandemic has been hard on existing UK businesses across the UK. Strict national lockdown during the initial months forced all but essential business to close, and later reopen with multiple restrictions. But many first-time entrepreneurs like Caroline was have gone ahead and taken the plunge despite less than ideal economic conditions.</p>

              <p>Initial <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/datasets/businessdemographyquarterlyexperimentalstatisticsuk">data</a> released by the Office for National Statistics suggests that people have not been deterred from starting new ventures. There were 88,960 new businesses across the United Kingdom between April to June 2020 compared to a figure of 101,990 during the same period in 2019.</p>

              <p>England saw 79,025 new business registrations while in Wales saw there were 4,665 registrations, followed by Scotland and Northern Ireland at 3,975 and 1,295, respectively.</p>

              <p>“The pandemic definitely played a big role firstly by giving us the inspiration for the idea and secondly by giving us the time needed to execute it and launch a business,” adds Caroline, “so it was a kind of blessing in disguise for us.”</p>

              <p>Unemployment also pushed people into starting their own ventures. According to the ONS, the number of employees on UK payrolls in August was <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/september2020">down by 695,000</a> compared to March this year.<p>

              <p>Jay Lee was one of them. Two weeks into the lockdown, Jay was made redundant from his job as a mortgage advisor and fraud investigator at a bank.</p>

              <p>“We expected several people to lose their jobs, but it turned out that all of my colleagues including me were made redundant,” says Jay.</p>

              <p>“It was an extremely worrying situation as not only had we lost our jobs, the lockdown meant that we couldn’t find any other jobs to keep us going until the situation improved.”</p>

              <p>Jay used his newly freed up schedule to design mortgage adviser training courses and started <a href = "https://uacademy.co.uk/">uAcademy</a> for those aspiring to get into the field. He built the website by following YouTube tutorials and within a few weeks, he was making enough money to meet his household expenses.</p>

              <p>“Many of my customers had been furloughed and some had even lost their jobs due to the pandemic,” says Jay. “I believe that the lockdown clearly helped sales. He believes the lockdown helped his new business, “as most people were at home and they had the time to learn new skills and even change careers.”</p>

              <p>Ever since its launch, uAcademy has had over 2000 students.</p>

              <p>“I’m now earning the same amount as I was with my previous job and am working even harder to make this a success.”</p>

              <p>Mark Bowden on the other hand decided to take voluntary redundancy from his previous job to start <a href = "https://cobaltbeach.com/">Cobalt Beach</a>, a data & technology consultancy firm based in Brighton, England.</p>

              <p>“After spending a few years in the corporate world, I knew I wanted to start something of my own,” says Mark.</p>

              <p>While his business plan did not account for a global pandemic, it ended up helping the firm more than he had anticipated.</p>

              <p>“Companies that usually relied on old pen and paper methods suddenly had to adapt to working remotely,” says Mark. “Updating their technology never took precedence earlier because it wasn’t an immediate concern, but the pandemic changed that. Pubs and restaurants also needed help getting online.”</p>

              <p>According to ONS data, Business Administration & Support Services was the sector with the most new businesses at 22,980 registrations.</p>

              <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/3743108"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

              <p>As of September 2020, Cobalt Beach serves 7 clients, more than the target Mark had planned for by the end of the year.</p>

              <p>While he currently has no staff, he outsources work to freelancers and graduate students at the University of Essex.</p>

              <p>Political and social events across the globe also inspired new ventures. The Black Lives Matter movement inspired a flurry of support for black-owned businesses all over social media.</p>

              <p>Francesca Aiyeola, a London-based data manager, built a directory for vetted Black-owned businesses called <a href = "https://akanuche.com/">Akanuchè</a>.</p>

              <p>“I wanted to create a platform where people could go on and find the best Black- owned businesses globally, and businesses that they could trust that would provide a quality service and were professional,” says Francesca. “I’m trying to change the way Black- owned businesses are perceived globally.”</p>

              <p>Although Francesca had been carrying around the idea for months (ever since a botched hair appointment at a London salon earlier this year), the Black Lives Matter movement gave her the much-needed boost and momentum to finally launch Akanuchè. The site went live in June.</p>

              <p>“I was working slowly because I have a day job as well. I could have waited maybe another month to launch it, but there was conversation around that time about supporting Black- owned businesses.”</p>

              <p>While it is still early days for Akanuchè, Francesca plans to turn it into a full-fledged PR, advertising, and marketing agency in the future, expanding the gamut of services she offers to her clients.</p>

              <p>“Eventually I want to remove the word ‘Black-owned’ and I want people to use Akanuchè because they’re going to find quality businesses,” says Francesca.</p>

              <p>“At the end of the day, professionals want to be known for their work, they don’t want to be known for the colour of their skin.”</p>
